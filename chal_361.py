[2018-05-16] Challenge #361 [Intermediate] ElsieFour low-tech cipher
Description

ElsieFour (LC4) is a low-tech authenticated encryption algorithm that can be computed by hand. Rather than operating on octets, the cipher operates on this 36-character alphabet:

#_23456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Each of these characters is assigned an integer 0â€“35. The cipher uses a 6x6 tile substitution-box (s-box) where each tile is one of these characters. A key is any random permutation of the alphabet arranged in this 6x6 s-box. Additionally a marker is initially placed on the tile in the upper-left corner. The s-box is permuted and the marked moves during encryption and decryption.

See the illustrations from the paper (album).

Each tile has a positive "vector" derived from its value: (N % 6, N / 6), referring to horizontal and vertical movement respectively. All vector movement wraps around, modulo-style.

To encrypt a single character, locate its tile in the s-box, then starting from that tile, move along the vector of the tile under the marker. This will be the ciphertext character (the output).

Next, the s-box is permuted. Right-rotate the row containing the plaintext character. Then down-rotate the column containing the ciphertext character. If the tile on which the marker is sitting gets rotated, marker goes with it.

Finally, move the marker according to the vector on the ciphertext tile.

Repeat this process for each character in the message.

Decryption is the same, but it (obviously) starts from the ciphertext character, and the plaintext is computed by moving along the negated vector (left and up) of the tile under the marker. Rotation and marker movement remains the same (right-rotate on plaintext tile, down-rotate on ciphertext tile).

If that doesn't make sense, have a look at the paper itself. It has pseudo-code and a detailed step-by-step example.
Input Description

Your program will be fed two lines. The first line is the encryption key. The second line is a message to be decrypted.
Output Description

Print the decrypted message.

Bonus

Also add support for encryption. If the second line begins with % (not in the cipher alphabet), then it should be encrypted instead.

If you want to get really fancy, also add support for nonces and signature authentication as discussed in the paper. The interface for these is up to you.
